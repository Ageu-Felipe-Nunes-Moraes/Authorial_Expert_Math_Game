# Math Expert

I, Ageu Felipe Nunes Moraes, developed an educational game called Math Expert from concept to implementation, aimed at improving mathematical reasoning speed. Inspired by my aspiration to strengthen essential cognitive skills for programming, I created this game to challenge players to solve math operations within a time limit.

## Features

- **Math Challenges:** The game presents random math operations to be solved.
- **Time Limit:** Players have a limited time to solve as many operations as possible.
- **Different Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose from various difficulty levels that affect the game's duration.
- **Scoring:** Each correctly solved operation increases the player's score.

## Installation Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Required Libraries

- `pygame`: For game development.
- `random`: For generating random numbers.
- `os`: For operating system operations, can be used to manipulate directories and files.

## How to Play

1. Ensure that Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository of this game.
3. Run the main game file.
4. On the start screen, choose one of the available difficulty levels.
5. The game will start, presenting math operations to be solved.
6. Click on the correct answer for each operation within the time limit.
7. Each correct operation will increase your score.
8. After the time is up, you can restart the game if desired.
